# Teaching Computational Geometry and Topology


# Development

The site is developed using Jekyll. For more details read about
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on its web page.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub.

To set up your environment to develop on the site, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test the site run `bundle
exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`.  This
starts a Jekyll server running the site. Add pages, documents, data, etc.  As
you make modifications to the site it will regenerate and you should see the
changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
