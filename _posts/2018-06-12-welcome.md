Welcome to the CG/CT educational blog!

We hope to use this forum for the free exchange of ideas and resources for the
effective teaching of computational geometry and computational topology.
<!--excerpt-->
We hope this blog can help to serve many members of the broad community --  those
considering to teach a CG/CT course for the first time, those looking for ways
to incorporate CG/CT topics into an existing course, those who have been
teaching CG/CT courses and want to hear about novel ideas and approaches, those
who are students of CG/CT who are looking to get the most out of their classes,
and those who are researchers in CG/CT or related fields who are looking for
resources to expand their knowledge and training.

Please share your ideas and experiences!
